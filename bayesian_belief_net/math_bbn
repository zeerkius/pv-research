This model was made to model breast cancer diagnosis using a Bayesian Belief Network. It is based on Bayes theorem 
which is defined as , P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B).
We take advantage of this and create a tree of statistical inferences based on observed conditional probability.
This tree or "network" has a given markov conditon so we know how much conditions to apply for each probaility calculation.
In this model the markov conditon was each node was dependent on its parents ; where each node could have up to three parents.

ex. lets say each feature can either be true of false 
we are looking at the instance where , X = T , Z = F , N = F
the graph would look something like below

    X  Z   N
    \  |  /
     \ | /
      \|/
       y

The calculation looks like

# we calculate the true case
P(y = T| X = T , Z = F , N = F) ~ 0.53

# and the false case
P(y = F| X = T , X = F , N = F) ~ 0.27

true = [0.53]

false = [0.27]

    y  k   p
    \  |  /
     \ | /
      \|/
       f

# we repeat for the next step of the tree where we are looking at features y = T , k = T , p = T
f is our target feature


P(f = T| y = T , k = T , p = T) ~ 0.21

P(f = F| y = T , k = T , p = T) ~ 0.65

true = [0.53 , 0.21]

false = [0.27 ,0.65]

# we calculate the final probability like this
we multiply each probability after eachother as they are independent events like we do in counting

ex.
P(A) * P(B) ... * P(Z)

then which ever probability is higher will be our classification

here is some sample pseudocode

def prod(arr):
    start = 1
    for x in arr:
      start *= x

T = prod(true)
F = prod(false)

if T >= F:
    return T
else:
    return F
