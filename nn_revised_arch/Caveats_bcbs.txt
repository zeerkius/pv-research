Overview
This risk estimation dataset includes 2,392,998 screening mammograms (called the "index mammogram") from women included in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. All women did not have a previous diagnosis of breast cancer and did not have any breast imaging in the nine months preceding the index screening mammogram. However, all women had undergone previous breast mammography in the prior five years (though not in the last nine months). Cancer registry and pathology data were linked to the mammography data and incident breast cancer (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ) within one year following the index screening mammogram was assessed.

To reduce the size of the dataset, the data have been aggregated by the cross-classification of risk factors and outcome with a count indicating the frequency of each combination. This reduces the dataset to 280,660 records. The variables in the ASCII dataset "risk.txt" are described in the table.

To create a deidentified public use dataset, it is necessary to protect the confidentiality of the women, the radiology facilities, and the mammography registries. It is also necessary to protect current research in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. For these reasons, the data are limited to the variables below. Notably, the data do not include any dates, origin of the data, patient identifiers, nor the assessment (outcome) of the index screening mammogram.




Caveats:
Covariates (1, 2, 4-9, 11, 12 below) are based on self-report at time of the index mammogram. Breast density (3) is judged by the radiologist from the screening mammogram and result of the last mammogram (10) prior to the index mammogram is based on recorded data.
These data were recorded in the period 1996-2002. There has been a recent change in the BI-RADS breast density definition that may lead to greater use of the more extreme values (1 and 4).
Post-menopausal includes all women who report their periods have stopped permanently, or who are on hormone replacement, or who are age 55 or greater. Women under age 45 who report they are post-menopausal are excluded from the dataset.
Pre-menopausal women are women under age 55 who report their periods have not stopped permanently. Unknown menopausal status includes women 35-54 for whom menopausal information was unknown.
The data contains a variable (15) indicating whether an observation was in the training data (75% random sample) or the validation data (remaining 25%). If using the entire dataset this variable may be ignored.
If there was a positive family history in the first degree relatives, but the number of relatives with breast cancer could not be determined, it was coded as "1".
The count variable (16) must be used to obtain correct estimates.
While we believe the data to be both correct and reliable, there is always the possibility of error in the collection of such diverse data. The data in the mammography registries are updated annually. However, this dataset is static and there is no plan to update this data.
