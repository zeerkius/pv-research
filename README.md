Result 
Concurring with the paper and hypothesis BMI , when isolated against Race makes model features more significant in 3/5 Models except Decison Tree & Sinusodal Regression after comparing p-values from this dataset. Both Features Make the features more signifigant only using K-NN after comparing p values from this dataset. Each Model instatiation was compared against a random model to compute Chi-Test.
